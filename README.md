# Purity Cooldown Remover

It is mainly a rewrite of [this other mod](https://thunderstore.io/package/ProfessorOwl/PurityCompletelyRemovesCooldowns/) BUT:
 - I know what I am doing;
 - This mod works properly.

Plus, it works with RoR2's Anniversary Update, and it is [open source](https://github.com/AryToNeX/PurityCooldownRemover).
